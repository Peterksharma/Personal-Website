| I load their portfolio                                               | I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them                                                                                                    |
| I click one of the links in the navigation                           | The UI scrolls to the corresponding section                                        |
| I click on the link to the section about their work                  | The UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications     |    
| I am presented with the developer's first application                | That application's image should be larger in size than the others                  |
| I click on the images of the applications                            | I am taken to that deployed application                                            |
| I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices    | I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport                 |

<small>Note: If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.</small>
